- unpack as usually inside the PLUGINS dir of the VDR version against you want to build
- building the subplugins requires the main plugin to be already installed on the target
system, therefore you should execute the following sequence:

make
make install
make subplugins
make install-subplugins

 - of course, executing the "install*" targets directly will build the binaries first...
 - for building / installing just certain subplugins explicitely, just change to their
 respective directories and execute 'make' / 'make install' there;
 
 - further targets are remove & remove-subplugins
