Description:

UPnP/DLNA Plugin for Video Disk Recorder

This Plugins extends the VDR with the possibility to act as an UPnP/DLNA Media
Server (DMS). It will serve VDR's contents in the network to any UPnP-AV and
DLNA capable devices.

The plugin requires a valid network connection with a IPv4 address. It will find
its settings automatically by default. In this case, the first network device in
the network device list with a valid IPv4 address and port 49152 will be used
for connections. You can change this behavior either by setting the command line
options or by editing the setup via the VDRs setup page.

Dependencies:

This plugin is tested with and requires the following libraries to work:

libupnp-1.6.6               The UPnP SDK
libsqlite-3.6               SQLite 3 Database
libtntnet-2.0               TNTnet library web server
libtntdb-1.1.1              TNTdb library database connector

boost::spirit               Grammar parser
boost::function             Boost function library
boost::bind                 Boost bind library

The boost libraries are usually available in a packed version, so that only a
single installation is required.

If you want to know everything about the code, please see the source code
documentation at http://upnp.vdr-developer.org/docs/ where all public members
are explained.

I appreciate, if you help making the plugin better. If you find any project
related errors or missing features, please open a new ticket at the plugin
website with a detailed description of what you want or what happened.

Firewall:

If you want to use the plugin behind a firewall, then you need to open the
following ports:

1900            UDP     SSDP (Simple Service Discorvery Protocol)
2869            TCP     SSDP (Simple Service Discorvery Protocol)
7649            TCP		Web server default port
3000            TCP     Streamdev default port
8001            TCP     Live default port
User defined    TCP     Data

The user defined port may be set automatically by the server or by the user via
the setup or command line options. You need to accept multicast messages from
239.255.255.250, which is used by SSDP to discover other UPnP devices.
