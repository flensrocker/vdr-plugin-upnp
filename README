Description:

UPnP/DLNA Plugin for Video Disk Recorder

This Plugins extends the VDR with the possibility to act as an UPnP/DLNA Media
Server (DMS). It will serve VDR's contents in the network to any UPnP-AV and
DLNA capable devices.

The plugin requires a valid network connection with a IPv4 address. It will find
its settings automatically by default. In this case, the first network device in
the network device list with a valid IPv4 address and port 49152 will be used
for connections. You can change this behavior either by setting the command line
options or by editing the setup via the VDRs setup page. The command line
options have a higher priority and substitute the menu settings.

The command line settings are:
  -i <interface>  --int=<interface>   The server network
                                      interface
                                      e.g: eth0, wlan1 etc.
                                      If given option '-a' must
                                      be absent.
  -a <address>    --address=<address> The server IPv4 address.
                                      If given option '-i' must
                                      be absent.
  -p <port>       --port=<port>       The server port
                                      Supported ports:
                                      0           (auto detect)
                                      49152-65535 (user defined)

If not options are set, menu options will be used.

The server has a unique identifier, which is
"uuid:b120ba52-d88d-4500-9b64-888971d83fd3". Other devices in the network can
find and identify the VDR UPnP Server with this ID. However, the server should
be found automatically and being listed under the supported media server
devices. If not, please report this as a bug on the projects homepage or send an
email to the developers of this plugin with the full device description and, if
applicable, the errors thrown by the media player device and the server.
