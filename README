Description:

UPnP/DLNA Plugin for Video Disk Recorder

This Plugins extends the VDR with the possibility to act as an UPnP/DLNA Media
Server (DMS). It will serve VDR's contents in the network to any UPnP-AV and
DLNA capable devices.

The plugin requires a valid network connection with a IPv4 address. It will find
its settings automatically by default. In this case, the first network device in
the network device list with a valid IPv4 address and port 49152 will be used
for connections. You can change this behavior either by setting the command line
options or by editing the setup via the VDRs setup page. The command line
options have a higher priority and substitute the menu settings.

The command line settings are:
  -i <interface>  --int=<interface>   The server network
                                      interface
                                      e.g: eth0, wlan1 etc.
                                      If given option '-a' must
                                      be absent.
  -a <address>    --address=<address> The server IPv4 address.
                                      If given option '-i' must
                                      be absent.
  -p <port>       --port=<port>       The server port
                                      Supported ports:
                                      0           (auto detect)
                                      49152-65535 (user defined)
  -d              --autodetect        Force auto detection
                                      Use this option to
                                      overwrite the setup menu
                                      options.
  -v              --verbose           Increase verbosity level
                                      The more v options the
                                      higher the output level

The verbose option can be more than once. With each option the verbosity level
will be increased. The maximum level is 5. Further options are silently ignored.

  -v                                  Print most important messages
  -vv                                 Print messages from the components
                                      i.e. the webserver, CDS, CMS, etc.
  -vvv                                Print messages from receivers and players
                                      and other additional components
  -vvvv                               You can't get enough, hum?
                                      This will print SQL messages and DIDL
                                      messages
  -vvvvv                              Can you read the matrix? You can't?
                                      Then try first reading SQL statements,
                                      fetches, buffer and parser outputs or
                                      any other outputs.

If not options are set, menu options will be used.

The server has a unique identifier, which is
"uuid:b120ba52-d88d-4500-9b64-888971d83fd3". Other devices in the network can
find and identify the VDR UPnP Server with this ID. However, the server should
be found automatically and being listed under the supported media server
devices. If not, please report this as a bug on the projects homepage or send an
email to the developers of this plugin with the full device description and, if
applicable, the errors thrown by the media player device and the server.

Dependencies:

This plugin is tested with and requires the following libraries to work:

libupnp-1.6.6               The UPnP SDK
libsqlite-3.6               SQLite 3 Database
libavcodec-svn20090303      FFMPEG Library for analyzing audio video codecs
libavformat-svn20090303     FFMPEG Library for analyzing audio video formats
boost::spirit               Grammar parser
boost::function             Boost function library
boost::bind                 Boost bind library

The boost libraries are usually available in a packed version, so that only a
single installation is required. The FFMPEG libraries comes with FFMPEG itself.

ATTENTION: DO NOT USE ANOTHER VERSION OF LIBUPNP.

libupnp-1.8.0 is known not to work with this plugin! Versions below 1.6.6 may
work. However, there may exist some unknown issues.
