# This is the channel title configuration
# %chan%  - replaced with the channel name
# %no%    - replaced with the channel number
# %title% - replaced with the event title
# 
# You may add a delimiter to the variable:
#
# %- |title% - this will add "- " to the output
#              if and only if the title is not
#              empty.
#
# The default pattern is: %no% %chan% %- |title%
#
# This will produce for instance
#
# 102 arte
#
# or if the title is not empty:
#
# 102 arte - New York
#
# Options:
# 
# Some variables may have options. They are separated
# by ';' from the variable. Each option is again
# separated by ';'.
#
# %no;<width>%
#   - width:   specifies the number of digits the
#              channel number may have. If the number
#              has less digits, they are filled with
#              leading zeros.
