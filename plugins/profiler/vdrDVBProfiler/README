Description:

The DVB profiler sub-plug in profiles live-TV channels and VDR
recordings and finds their specific DLNA profile.

The following profiles are supported regarding the channel
properties:

SD channels and recordings: MPEG_TS_SD_EU_ISO
HD channels and recordings: AVC_TS_HD_EU_ISO

Radio channels and recordings as well as old PES recordings are
currently not supported.

Configuration:

The DVB provider has a configuration file called 'channelTitle.conf'
which can be used to customize the channels title shown by the
server while browsing the live-TV containers.

It is optional and only required if the user want to display
more or less information in the content browser.

The configuration file must be copied to the configuration directory
of the UPnP plugin. For instance: /var/lib/vdr/plugins/upnp.

The configuration itself is explained inside the example shipped
with this sub-plugin
