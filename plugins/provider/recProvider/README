Description:

The recording provider provides access to VDR recordings. It scans
the recording directories given by the VDRs internal structure and
returns a list of recording resources.

It provides the following URI scheme:   rec://

Additionally, it is used to access the recording files for streaming.

The provider implemented the seekable interface and therefore allows
seeking in the recordings via byte based seeks.
