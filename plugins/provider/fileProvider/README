Description:

The file provider provides access to any files on the file system. It
scans all files, which listed in the directory configuration file of
the sub-plug in.

It provides the following URI scheme:   file://

Additionally, it is used to access the files for streaming.

The provider implemented the seekable interface and therefore allows
seeking in the files via byte based seeks.
